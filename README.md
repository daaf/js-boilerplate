# js-boilerplate
Super basic boilerplate for a Javascript webapp.

This is for my personal use, and I'm a beginner, so it's very bare bones. For now, it contains:
- The holy trinity: index.html, index.js, styles.css
- Basic NPM config
- Basic Webpack config
- A few NPM scripts to run Webpack commands
- A few Webpack loaders:  style-loader, css-loader, file-loader

However I hope to keep the boilerplate updated as I continue to learn about more useful tools and adopt them into my workflow.
